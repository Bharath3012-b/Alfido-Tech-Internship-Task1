Project Overview: Iris Flower Classification

Objective:
The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that classifies iris flowers into three species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) based on their sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. This helps in understanding the basics of supervised learning and classification.

Key Activities:

Data loading using Pandas.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize feature distributions.

Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.

Building and training a Decision Tree Classifier using Scikit-learn.

Predicting results and evaluating model performance using accuracy score, classification report, and confusion matrix.

Visualizing the confusion matrix.

Modules Used:

Pandas – for reading and handling CSV data

NumPy – for numerical operations

Matplotlib – for plotting histograms and evaluation visuals

Seaborn – for enhanced visualizations

Scikit-learn – for model building, data splitting, and evaluation

Main Code Modules:

Data Input Module – loads and displays the dataset

Visualization Module – plots feature distributions

Preprocessing Module – prepares data for training

Modeling Module – trains the Decision Tree Classifier

Evaluation Module – checks accuracy and plots confusion matrix
